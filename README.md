I wanted to create a portfolio that really showcased me and my stylistic mindset. I love the color yellow - I am quite annoying - I'm the girl who has her favorite color as one of her personality traits. 
It's not an intentional annoying thing I do but rather a cheesy story behind why I love this color so much. In highschool I had a realy tough time personally - long story short, I  struggled with a plethora of things - and yellow started to show up consistenly - so naturally I started buying yellow this and yellow that. The color made me feel seen and made feel happier for just a moment or so and I needed that clarity. Ever since then I have come to own tons and tons of things that are indeed yellow. So anyways that's why I wanted to make my theme yellow because I knew for a fact I would have a hard time completing this project and I would face challenges along the way.. However, taking a deep breath and looking at yellow always made it just a little more bearable. 

Moving on from yellow. I wanted my website to have 3 columns because in the prework webpage assignment I had a hard time doing that and I was never able to figure it out, so I figured that would be a good challenge for myself. I was able to get the 3 columns set up but then I realized when my screen was small the columns were super tiny so I had to make sure I created a media query to fix that and to make them stack on top of each other. I also wanted ONE of my point of interaction to be expanding the paragraphs of my 3 columns. That was also a challenge in its self because I had to use animation in jquery and I messed with things here and there to get it to where it is at now. I want to explore more with animations in the future. 

I wanted my second point of interaction to be the carousel since that was still fresh in my mind from this week. I figured it would be good practice to create another one with my own style implemented. This will be where I showcase my future porjects - but for now they are beautiful pictures that contain yellow! Underneath I want to have a link for details of whatever project I have showcased so whoever is looking can really take a look at the details of the work I have created. 

I wanted my third interactoin to be a quiz. I liked being able to use buttons on w03d01 for the lab. I figured it would be a good challenge to create a quiz that required me to use jQuery to make things happen when the user clicks a button. I tried a lot of things to get the buttons to work and I resorted to an array of objects because I just wanted my buttons to be able to work properly! Which in the end they did and in the future I'll be able to create a more lengthy quiz! 

I wanted all my links to have a hover functionality with a yellow background - so that was really fun for me to make all of those have a yellow shadow!

I have become really comfortable using hide(),show(),text(), and on.('click' , () => {}) functions. 

I think it's so cool that you can use javascript and jQuery to make things actually happen on your website!

I took the approach of giving pretty much every tag a class with the mindset that at any point I could style that tag specifically with any hassles other than referencing the class name.

Unsolved Problems: 

- My last set of buttons are stacking and I didnt want them to be. 
- The box containing the quiz refuses to move from the left side of the page so I'll have to mess with that more. 
- On my Quiz page the yellow background in the header and footer don't touch the sides when it gets smalller. 
- My animation doesn't work exactly like I want it to but it still looks good.
