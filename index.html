                    <img src="business.jpg" alt="" class="img-about">
                    <p>
                    What do I plan to achieve in my career? I really want to explore the tech world and find out where I am able to grow the most. 
                    My end goal through this entire journey is to work with like minded individuals - who thrive off working together to make a 
                    difference in our world. I enjoy doing things for others that will leave a significant impact on them. I take pride in having 
                    someone remember me for the good I have done. I thrive off positivity and I absolutely love to spread it. As long as I work with 
                    people who can offer a different perspective and open my mind just a little more each project - I will be more than happy. I love 
                    to learn new ways of productivity and I’m always exploring how I can make the most out of my time. I confidently say I am a natural
                    problem solver - which they often say - you have to be in order to be successful in the tech world. There’s so many opportunities 
                    for growth and movement in Software Engineering - which is why I love this field - because I feel there are endless possibilities. 
                    If one venture fails, there's always another business looking for what I have to offer.

                    <h3>Educational Background</h3>
                    <img src="graduation.jpg" alt="" class="img-about">
                    <p>
                    I graduated from Tom C. Clark Highschool in San Antonio, TX. I went to the University of Texas at San Antonio where 
                    I took out loans to attend my first semester of college for Computer Engineering. I quickly learned I was in debt and I 
                    was not totally devoted to my major. I hit a bit of a crisis mode when the first semester had ended and I was more lost 
                    with what my future would hold. I talked to my parents about some sort of plan - I didn’t want to give up on something I 
                    started but I also knew I would just continue to rack up debt if I continued to go to college because my parents couldn’t 
                    afford to support my college funds. My dad reassured me that I didn’t need to go to college and that was okay. He introduced 
                    me to his field of expertise and said I didn’t have to rack up debt to be successful in the tech world. I quickly fell in 
                    love with coding and the idea of being able to create a plethora of things from simply coding. My dreams finally opened up 
                    and my plan for the future finally seemed to be in order.

                    <h3>Family Background</h3>
                    <img src="family.jpg" alt="" class="img-about">
                    <p>
                    I grew up the youngest out of four kids. I take a lot of pride in my family background because
                    the person I am today has a lot to do with the way I grew up. Growing up the youngest forced me to be
                    very cooperative with others - hence having to learn to share with three other kids. I had the opportunity to watch
                    each of my siblings grow up and evolve to who they are today and in return I was able to see what kind of
                    person I aspired to be. Meanwhile, my parents were really hard workers in order to support us as a family.
                    I look up to my dad because he is a self taught software engineer. Growing up, he would constantly be studying
                    for the next certification to wrap under his belt in order to continually strive for the next job. I look up to
                    my mom because she supported her own family growing up as a kid. She taught us how to look out for one another
                    and how to push through adversity and self doubt. She was my rock through my adolescence she kept my afloat and
                    grounded to the reality of life and what actually matters. I moved out of my house and started to support myself 
                    during the pandemic where I moved to Austin, TX away from my home town and parents with my boyfriend, Will. We both
                    push each other to keep working hard and strive to reach our career goals together.
